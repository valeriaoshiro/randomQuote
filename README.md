Completed September 20, 2016

This is a Harry Potter random quote machine. It access the quotes from a JSON file hosted in Dropbox. It gives you a new quote when you press the New Quote button. Also, you are able to tweet the quote and it inserts the hashtag quotes. 


## Requirements
- I can click a button to show me a new random quote.
- I can press a button to tweet out a quote.

## Experience learned
- Learned about APIs, JSON, and AJAX.
- Learned how to host my own JSON file in Dropbox. The file contained Harry Potter quotes that I gathered around the Internet.
- Only used jQuery to access the quotes ( .getJSON() ). The rest of the project was done in JavaScript.
- Learned how to manipulate the DOM.
- Didnâ€™t use Bootstrap. Styled the project with CSS only. Used media query to make it responsive.
- **Extra**: The book cover changes depending which book the quote came from.
